# Machine Learning from Scratch

Welcome to the "Machine Learning from Scratch" repository! This project aims to demystify the inner workings of popular machine learning algorithms by implementing them from the ground up. Each algorithm is explained in detail, with step-by-step code and theoretical explanations.

## Acknowledgements

This repository is inspired by the desire to understand machine learning algorithms by implementing them from scratch. It is intended for educational purposes and to foster a deeper understanding of how these algorithms work.

## Algorithms Included

1. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

2. **Linear Regression**

3. **Logistic Regression**

4. **Decision Trees**

5. **Random Forest**

6. **Naive Bayes**

7. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**

8. **Perceptron**

9. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**

10. **K-Means Clustering**

## Getting Started

To run the code in this repository, you will need:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- Scikit-learn (for dataset examples and comparisons)

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```python
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```
