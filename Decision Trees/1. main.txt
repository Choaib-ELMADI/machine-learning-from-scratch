1. Definition:
    => A Decision Tree is a supervised learning algorithm that works by splitting the data into subsets based on the most significant attribute at each node.
    -> This forms a tree structure where:
        - each internal node represents a decision rule on an attribute
        - each branch represents the outcome of the rule
        - each leaf node represents the final output or decision

2. Tree Structure:
    => Root node: The top node of the tree that represents the entire dataset.
    => Internal nodes: Nodes that represent tests or decisions based on an attribute. These nodes split the data into subsets based on a condition.
    => Leaf nodes: The terminal nodes that represent the final decision or output.
