* Steps:
    What we do with logistic regression:
        -> Training:
            - Initialize weights as zero
            - Initialize bias as zero

        -> Given a data point:
            - Predict result by using: y = 1 / (1 + e^(-w.x + b))
            - Calculate error
            - Use gradient descent to figure out new weight and bias values
            - Repeat n times

        -> Testing:
            - Given a data point, put in the values from the data point into the equation: y = 1 / (1 + e^(-w.x + b))
            - Choose the label based on the probability
