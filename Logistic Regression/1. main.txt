1. Definition:
    => Logistic Regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for binary classification problems.
    -> Unlike linear regression, which is used for predicting continuous values, logistic regression is used to predict the probability of a binary outcome.
    -> The core idea is to model the probability that a given input belongs to a particular class.

* Estimation:
    With logistic regression, what we are trying to do is to create probabilities instead of a specific value.
    
    And to do that, what we are going to do is to put in our value inside the sigmoid function:
        * σ(x) = 1 / (1 + e^(-x))
    and then get a probability distribution that will be between 0 and 1.
    This probability is used to classify the input into one of the two classes (1 if P is above a threshold, typically 0.5, and 0 otherwise).

    The equation, then, goes from y = w.x + b to y = 1 / (1 + e^(-w.x + b)).

* Calculating Error:
    In logistic regression, instead of using mean squared error, we are using something called cross entropy:
        * J(w, b) = J(θ)
